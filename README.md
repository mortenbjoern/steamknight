# Steam Knight
Steam Knight is a top down turn-based game, drawing inspiration from old dungeon crawlers.

## Getting started

2. [Download](https://github.com/mortenbjoern/steamknight/archive/master.zip) Steam Knight right here on our Github page
3. Unpack the zip and rename the folder to "main"
4. Start the Processing IDE and open "main.pde" in the folder you just renamed
5. That's it! Go collect some coins and dodge some traps.
